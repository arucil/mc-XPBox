# XPBox
This is 1.10.2 port for Minecraft MOD ExPContainer (originally made by clocka [[OP Link]](http://forum.minecraftuser.jp/viewtopic.php?t=15105), [Flithor](https://github.com/Flithor) ported it to 1.12).  
This MOD adds a block that stores players' xp and persists, be it broken or the player is dead (acting like ender chests).
