# XPBox
This is a Minecraft 1.10.2 MOD introducing a XP container, inspired by ExPContainer made by clocka [[OP Link]](http://forum.minecraftuser.jp/viewtopic.php?t=15105).  
This MOD adds a block that stores players' xp and persists, be it broken or the player is dead (acting like ender chests).  
1.12/1.12.2 version is at another branch.
